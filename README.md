A WIP open-source finance calculator and planner.
Has built-in AES-128 Encryption for sensitive data and stores all files locally as encrypted JSON (plain text is optional).
Currently this project lacks a front-end.
This project was written with modularity (MVC principles) readability (mostly focused on the code exposed by the API) and reusability in mind.

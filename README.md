A WIP open-source finance calculator and planner.
Has built-in AES-128 Encryption for sensitive data and stores all files locally as encrypted JSON (plain text is optional).
Currently this project lacks a front-end. Also planned is a webasm version that can be "downloaded" in the browser, running as a service host and using local storage to even enable offline usage.
This project was written with modularity (MVC principles) readability (mostly focused on the code exposed by the API) and reusability in mind. Should be compilable for all targets supported by the Qt library, only Visual Studio project files will be supplied.
